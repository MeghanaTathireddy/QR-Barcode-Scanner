# QR-Barcode-Scanner
This is a real-time desktop application built with Python, OpenCV, and Pyzbar that uses your webcam to detect and decode QR codes and barcodes. It highlights detected codes on the video feed and allows users to click on QR code regions to automatically open URLs in their browser.

Project Overview
Detects and decodes barcodes and QR codes from webcam input.

Draws bounding boxes and overlays decoded text on the video stream.

Supports clickable regions: If a QR code contains a URL, clicking on it will open the link in the default browser.

Ideal for lightweight local use â€” no internet or server required.
